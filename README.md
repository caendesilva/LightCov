# LightCov - Simplistic Open Source CI/CD Code Coverage Platform

## Early Alpha - Not ready for production use

LightCov is a simplistic open source CI/CD code coverage platform. It is designed to be lightweight, easy to use, and intuitive.

LightCov aims to do two things, and to do them well:
1. Track code coverage over time
2. Provide context to GitHub pull requests

## Features

### Supported Platforms

At this stage, only GitHub is planned. LightCov is designed to be used as part of a GitHub Actions on a pull request.

### Supported Languages

At this stage, a driver for PHP is planned. More languages can be added in the future.

## Usage

### Using our service

You can request beta access to LightCov (https://lightcov.desilva.se) by sending a Tweet to the author, [@CodeWithCaen](https://twitter.com/CodeWithCaen).

Free access is planned for open source projects with highly reasonable rate limits. Commercial use may be subject to a fee to cover hosting costs.

### Self-hosting

Self-hosting at this stage is not recommended. The project is in early alpha and is not ready for production use.
There will be breaking changes. But until a version 1.0 is released, no support whatsoever will be provided for self-hosting.

### Sponsoring

If you want to sponsor the development of LightCov, for example to pay for a more professional domain or even a dedicated server,
you can do so by buying me a coffee and making a note that it is for LightCov. [buymeacoffee.com/caen](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/caen)
